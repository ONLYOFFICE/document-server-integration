            Give a try to our test example which will allow you to upload your own local Office files from your computer for testing. It can be easily run with the following commands:

            <pre>sudo docker exec $(sudo docker ps -q) sudo supervisorctl start onlyoffice-documentserver:example</pre>

            Add the example to the autostart:
            <pre>sudo docker exec $(sudo docker ps -q) sudo sed 's,autostart=false,autostart=true,' -i /etc/supervisor/conf.d/onlyoffice-documentserver-example.conf</pre>

            Once started the example will be available <a href="/example">here</a>.
            <br>
            Please note, that the example is used for demonstration purposes only and it can be accessed by anyone. Once you finish examining it, we recommend that you disable this example for security reasons.

            <span>Have license?</span>
            <br>
            If you bought Document Server and received the license.lic file, you can place it to your installation to obtain the software full version. In case you are a Debian based Linux distributive user, the license file is placed to the following folder: 
            <pre>/var/www/onlyoffice/Data/license.lic</pre>
            In case you are using the docker container, the license.lic file can be placed to any folder (e.g. /opt/onlyoffice/Data/license.lic), but you will need to mount this folder when the container starts:
            <pre>docker run -itd -p 80:80 \
-v /opt/onlyoffice/Data:/var/www/onlyoffice/Data \
onlyoffice4enterprise/documentserver-ee</pre>

        <div class="help-block">
            <span>Any questions?</span>
