def boolean(string: Optional[str], default: bool = False) -> bool:
    '''
    Converts a string that represents a boolean value to its corresponding
    boolean value. It supports case-insensitive `true`, `t`, `yes`, `y`, and `1`
    for the positive value, and `false`, `f`, `no`, `n`, and `0` for the
    negative value. If the string doesn't match any of these values, returns the
    default value.
